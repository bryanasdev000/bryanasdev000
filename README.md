### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Proud Linux User (NixOS) and FLOSS lover.

I work as an infrastructure engineer at 4Linux with a focus on free software, graduated in Systems Analysis and Development by FATEC. Maintainer of NixOS and contributor to several Open Source projects, I have experience in several IT areas, from architecture to implementation of complex infrastructures using primarily infrastructure as code with a focus on high availability and cloud computing. I'm currently teaching "Terraform: Infraestrutura como cÃ³digo" on 4Linux and I hold the Terraform Associate certificate. In my spare time I usually develop in Golang or Python.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with infrastructure and a bit of development here and there
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kubernetes and its ecosystem
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Nix, NixOS, Kubernetes and Prometheus
